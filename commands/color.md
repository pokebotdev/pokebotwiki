## pb!color \(color\)

Pokemon can also be filtered and searched by color. Say a User remembers a Pokemon's color, Green for example but they cant remember its name, Ndex, or Category, they can use `pb!color green`.

{% hint style="info" %}
`colour` works too!

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes a color list will be too large to fit into one page so Pokebot will add pages to switch through.
