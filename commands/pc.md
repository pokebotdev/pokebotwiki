# Pokecord Prefix \(pc\) Command

## pb!pc \(Pokecord Prefix\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can only be changed by Admins or owners of a guild!
{% endhint %}

Users can make Pokebot change what prefix it sends for the [Special Feature](../special-feature.md). Default will be `p!` however if a server has changed this to `$` Users copying and pasting will have to type the Pokecord prefix themselves, avoid this by changing this option to the Pokecord prefix.
